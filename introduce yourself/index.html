            Our family loves goes on walks to the park, and hiking. We typically get out camping 
            maybe about 10 times a year for about 3-4 days each time.
            <hr/>
            My wife and boys go on runs together with esther in the running stroller.
            On most days we bring out dog sunshine who I trained to run along side us.
            when we are in a forest I usually let her run on her own while we are running.
            <hr/>
            I'm really hoping I can get my boys as involved in coding as I am. I 
            went through some simple minecraft coding with my youngest son on 08/22/24
            yesterday. I made things as simple and silly as possible to keep
            him interested.
